# Introduction

A chess cheat program to convert the best move to vibration inspired by Carlsenâ€“Niemann controversy. 

# Development Log

Today is 09.03.2025, the current version supports sending coordinates from PC to ESP32. Currently, I am designing a model that someone can wear.
In the future, I want to integrate image recognition for chess pieces and the location of chess pieces then feed them to Lichess API so I name the project Vichess.
